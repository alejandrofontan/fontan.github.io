      <p>Lukas Schmid is currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the <a href="https://web.mit.edu/sparklab/">MIT
          SPARK</a> Lab lead
        by <a href="https://lucacarlone.mit.edu/">Prof. Luca
          Carlone</a> at the <a href="https://www.mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</a>.
        Before that, he briefly was a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://asl.ethz.ch/">Autonomous
          Systems Lab (ASL)</a> lead by
        <a href="https://asl.ethz.ch/the-lab/people/person-detail.Mjk5ODE=.TGlzdC8yMDI4LDEyMDExMzk5Mjg=.html">Prof.
          Roland Siegwart</a> at <a href="https://ethz.ch/en.html">ETH Zürich</a>.
        He earned his PhD in 2022 from ETH Zürich,
        advised by <a
          href="https://asl.ethz.ch/the-lab/people/person-detail.Mjk5ODE=.TGlzdC8yMDI4LDEyMDExMzk5Mjg=.html">Prof.
          Roland Siegwart</a>, <a href="https://n.ethz.ch/~cesarc/">Dr. Cesar
          Cadena</a>, and <a href="https://www.nietojuan.com/">Dr. Juan
          Nieto</a>, where he also obtained his M.Sc. in Robotics, Systems, and Control (RSC) in 2019.
        During his PhD, he was a visiting researcher at the <a
          href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/mixed-reality-ai-zurich/">Microsoft
          Mixed Reality and AI Lab</a> lead by <a href="https://people.inf.ethz.ch/pomarc/">Prof. Marc
          Pollefeys</a>.
      </p>

      <p> His work has been recognized with several awards and honors, including the <a
          href="https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Khronos">Outstanding Systems Paper Award</a> at <a
          href="https://roboticsconference.org/">Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS)</a>, the <a
          href="https://ethz.ch/en/the-eth-zurich/education/awards/eth-medal.html">ETH Medal</a>
        for outstanding PhD theses, the <a
          href="https://ethz.ch/en/the-eth-zurich/education/awards/eth-medal/outstanding-master-theses.html">ETH
          Medal</a> for outstanding master theses, the <a
          href="https://ethz.ch/en/the-eth-zurich/education/awards/willi-studer-prize.html">Willi Studer
          Prize</a> for the best graduate of the year at ETH, the first place in the <a
          href="https://eval.nothing-stands-still.com/web/challenges/challenge-page/9/overview">2024
          Hilti SLAM challenge</a>, and a <a href="https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/214489">Swiss National Science
          Foundation</a> postdoc-mobility fellowship.
      </p>

      <p> His main research interests is in autonomy for intelligent mobile systems, where he focuses on active and
        passive 3D
        perception and understanding of complex, dynamic, and changing environments for robotic interaction and
        augmented reality. This includes research on dense geometric and semantic scene representations, scene
        abstraction and understanding, as well as detection and prediction of moving and changing entities.
        He complements this with research on lifelong learning and mapping, as well as active path planning to build
        these representations autonomously in unknown environments and enable continuous improvement of a robot's scene
        model and perception capabilities.
        While his work is grounded in rigorous theory, his methods are demonstrated on-board fully autonomous mobile
        robots and drones in complex real-world scenarios.

        Besides my work, I am a passionate classical pianist (four times winner of the 1<sup>st</sup> prize at the
        Thurgau Youth Music Competition, three times with award), but also used to play in piano trios and jazz
        ensembles.

      <p>
        I enjoy team sports such as volleyball, especially beach volleyball during summer, working out, and
        running. I also used to play Tennis and spent many years doing Wing Chun Kung Fu.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love exploring, tasting, and presenting wines and making cocktails (WSET Level 2 Award in Wines, WSET Level
        2
        Award in Spirits, both passed with distinction), and sharing these experiences with others.
      </p>
      <p>
        For recreation, I relish various water sports such as scuba diving (PADI Advanced Open Water Diver), sailing
        (Swiss Yachting Certificate, MIT provisional, 420, laser, windsurf, and lynx catboat rating) as well as wave,
        wake, and wind surfing.
